        <h1>Chicago Woman’s March</h1>
        <h2>250,000 people fill the streets in one of the largest protests in city history</h2>
        <h3>By DNAinfo <time>January 21, 2017</time></h3>
      
        <p><strong>DOWNTOWN —</strong> The Women's March on Chicago Saturday, held to unite people and protest newly inaugurated President Donald Trump, was reportedly the third largest march of its kind outside Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, organizers said.</p>
      
        <p><span id="overlay-cta"> The crowd</span> was so large that the march was canceled and organizers said they would rally in place — though thousands still took to the streets and it was substantially larger than most protests and rallies in the city's history.</p>

          <figcaption>"It was mind-blowing. It just shows there are a lot of women and women's advocates that wanted to make their voices heard," said organizer Liz Radford. "We were so happy to provide a forum where they could come out and do that. ... It was surreal."</figcaption>

        <p>At 2012's NATO Summit, police said there were 2,500-3,000 protesters, according to Reuters. The infamous Democratic National Convention of 1968 saw one demonstration with 5,000 people, according to the Chicago Tribune.</p>
      
        <p>The march was not the biggest protest in the city's history, though: That honor goes to a May 1, 2006, demonstration that saw an estimated 400,000 people march against anti-immigration laws.</p>
      
        <blockquote>This is a day that will change us forever <cite>Gloria Steinem</cite>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Organizer Jaquie Algee said there were no incidents at the march, adding there had been "nothing but love." She hopes the women's marches — which were held on all seven continents in numerous U.S. cities and foreign countries — will cause Trump to have a "serious change of mind" and work to forge a better relationship with women.</p>
